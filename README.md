Project: Software for Supporting Creative Professionals and Learners

This software is designed to assist professionals and learners in the creative sector by helping artists with project design and visualization.

The idea for this project came from feedback I received from many fellow students who found the use of GROOW to be cumbersome. However, I believe that process design and its documentation should be an enjoyable and seamless experience.

Key Features:
-   Collaborative Process Mapping: Work together with your team to map, understand, and improve processes.
-   Data Input for Visualizing Processes: Enter data to visualize processes, view them in context to clarify complexity, and align your team more effectively.
-   Detailed Process Descriptions: Create comprehensive process descriptions to understand, communicate, and identify potential improvements.
-   Efficiency Through Process Documentation and Optimization: Focus on improving efficiency in process documentation, process optimization, and project planning.
